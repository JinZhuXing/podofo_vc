PoDoFo library for windows using Visual Studio 2010.

This project was restructured for Visual Studio developer.

All source codes are in original PoDoFo repository.

## Build

First extract third_party.7z file to third_party directory.

After that, open PoDoFo.sln file and build.

And copy all DLL files from third_party to output directory.


## Third Party libraries

I will release third party libraries at Release.


## To-Do

Right now, only support Visual Studio 2010.

I will upgrade project to Visual Studio 2022 (or 2019) project later.

Thanks to PoDoFo project. üëç‚ú®
